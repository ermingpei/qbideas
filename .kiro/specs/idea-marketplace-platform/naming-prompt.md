## PROMPT:

I'm building a platform that needs a memorable, brandable name. Please help me generate name options and check domain availability patterns.

### Platform Overview:

**Concept:** An AI-powered platform that automatically generates, curates, and publishes ~10 thoroughly researched app/tool ideas daily. It combines AI generation with community contributions and monetizes through premium idea unlocks and auxiliary services (feasibility reports, technical planning, market research, implementation roadmaps).

**Target Audience:** "AI-enabled builders" - people who can now build apps using AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, etc.) but need validated, research-backed ideas for what to build.

**Core Value Proposition:** In an era where AI solves "how to build," we solve "what to build that's actually valuable."

**Key Features:**
- Daily AI-generated ideas with comprehensive market research
- Community idea contributions with revenue sharing
- Tiered access (free regular ideas, paid premium ideas)
- Full-service ecosystem (feasibility reports, technical planning, etc.)
- Modern, engaging Product Hunt-style discovery experience

### Naming Requirements:

1. **Memorable & Catchy:** Easy to say, spell, and remember (like TikTok, DeepSeek, ByteDance)
2. **AI-Related:** Should incorporate or suggest AI/technology (can use "AI" explicitly or implicitly)
3. **Action-Oriented:** Suggests building, creating, sparking, or discovering
4. **Modern & Premium:** Sounds like a contemporary tech platform, not generic
5. **Domain Available:** Prioritize names where .com, .io, .ai, or .co domains are likely available
6. **Brandable:** Works well for logo design, social media handles, app names
7. **International:** Easy to pronounce across different languages

### Name Style Preferences:

**Compound Words (Preferred):**
- Two words combined: IdeaSpark, BuildWise, SparkLab
- AI + Word: AIdeaSpark, SparkAI, BuildAI
- Word + Gen/Forge/Flow: IdeaGen, VentureForge, ThinkFlow

**Creative Blends:**
- Portmanteau words: Ideavent (Idea+Invent), Buildspark
- Unique but pronounceable: Like "DeepSeek" or "Anthropic"

**Avoid:**
- Generic marketplace terms (IdeaMarket, IdeaHub, etc.)
- Overly long names (more than 3 syllables preferred)
- Hard to spell or pronounce names
- Names too similar to existing major platforms

### Tasks:

1. **Generate 20-30 name options** following the requirements above
2. **Categorize them** by style (compound words, AI-focused, creative blends, etc.)
3. **For each name, provide:**
   - Pronunciation guide
   - Meaning/rationale
   - Suggested tagline
   - Domain options to check (.com, .io, .ai, .co)
   - Logo/visual identity ideas
   - Potential trademark concerns

4. **Rank your top 5 recommendations** with detailed reasoning

5. **For the top 5, suggest:**
   - Alternative spellings if domain is taken
   - Related available domains
   - Social media handle variations

6. **Bonus:** Check if these domains appear to be available (you can use your web search capability):
   - AIdeaSpark.io / .com
   - Sparkwise.ai
   - IdeaGen.ai
   - BuildGen.ai
   - SparkAI.io
   - VentureGen.ai
   - BuildsparkAI.io
